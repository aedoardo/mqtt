# MQTT fuzzer

This is the source code for the MQTT fuzzer that we used in our paper *Di Paolo, E., Bassetti, E., & Spognardi, A. (2021). Security assessment of common open source MQTT brokers and clients.*

## Requirements

This code was tested with Python 3.7. Libraries needed are specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Use in a venv

We suggest to setup a virtual environment to avoid conflicts and mismatched libraries:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

For more information about virtual envs please refer to the official documentation.
